If the manufacturer changed something  surely it s for the better  right?Not a chance. I hardly got halfway down my block when BOOM the rubber band let go (broke) the battery box flew off ripped the wire right out and launched itself to the ground.THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY HAZARD! DO NOT INSTALL THIS PRODUCT ON YOUR BICYCLE!!There s another video about these lights showing how the battery box mounts to the spokes with nice brackets that are screwed in for a secure mount. The manufacturer changed the product and it now uses a glorified rubber band to hold the battery box in place. It will surely rattle with every little bump you hit! Watch my video and see for yourself! These are coming off and being sent back. It s a shame  because other than the battery box the rest of the kit is excellent. I just can t rely on a piece of rubber to hold this box in place!       A 34 personas les resultó útil,1,2021-08-09T14:22:22
herman barlow jr.,-,They look good. Even with out front lights you wont be ...               These lights awesome>>>>I bought these because I was once using the wheel lights that screw onto your valcap.The problem was you only have one light. They would go about 3 to 5 day s & would need battery replacement  with 3 ag10 button cell batterys. (I ride about 6 night hours a week) The other is when motion stops the light stops. With about 15 led lights that  incircle your rim you are fully lit at all times. With these lights.you can push the function for flash or to sustaine the stedy light .They give off brillant lighting effect ( I got blue). They are simple  to install.>>>you simply unscrew the (3 ..AA battery pack)  to install .Strap the pack to your inner hub .Bring insulated (no light ) wire down your spoke to your rim & start  treading or wraping around your rim spokes.I have a 700 rim & it was  just shy of makin the full circle.The wire is very thin (like bread twist tie ). I  have already done 6 hours with these & they are still bright......Of corse with 3 AA  batterys & LED/ ...They look good. Even with out front lights you wont be missed.>>>Hope this was a help .       A 2 personas les resultó útil,5,2021-08-16T14:22:22
Jacaranda,-,Great design. Durable  bright  and colorful.               LEDs are encased in a plastic tube - much more durable than wire-only models. Battery pack spoke attachment is very secure design. Very durable. Easy access push button switch. After 100+ miles on my commute bike (bumpy pavement) still solid and functional. I really like the color-change feature over single color. Well-written instructions. I have another variety that is much less durable and the battery unit is a sloppy fit on the spokes. Worth the price.       A una persona le resultó útil,5,2021-03-15T14:22:22
Kindle Customer,-,Great product with tedious install/remove                                                                                                                                                                                                              No se pudo cargar el archivo multimedia.                                                                                                Plenty of length for my 29er wheels. Bright. Battery pack attaches simply and securely to the wheel (but may be a problem on radially-laced or low-spoke-count wheels). Using zip ties to hold the tube of lights in place makes installation tedious (about 15 minutes per wheel) and removal a precise operation (so as to not cut the light string with the diagonal cutters). If I had a bike or wheelset to commit to night rides I d just leave them in place. But I did a few miles of rocky singletrack and everything stayed in place  so the system works. One caveat: because others complained of getting knock-offs I considered ordering direct from the manufacturer. Using their online form I inquired about delivery times as I needed the lights for an event. They never replied. I ordered from Amazon with no issues. The video shows the lights only  lights with my headlamp on  and lights while riding next to a well-illuminated picnic shelter. I was running both Wheel Brightz and Go Brightz frame lights.

Nancy,-,Bright sturdy bike lights!               Have bought many LED lights for bicycles and the ones from Brightz re the longest lasting ones I have found. Easy to install  and very secure. They don t cut corners on their products and are so much more sturdy than some of the flimsy ones out there.       ,5,2021-02-01T14:22:22

Donna Bradford & Steve Bradford,-,Love these Bright Lights               Purchased these for my nephew s birthday - this is the 3rd set I ve purchased.  The kids LOVE them. They are bright and make the bikes easy to see at night in the yard or in our campground.  Fairly easy to install.  These are a great purchase.       ,5,2021-09-28T14:22:22
Alex,-,Great  if you get the real deal               I got these for my boyfriend.  So I originally ordered these from Amazon marketplace and by comparing the box I got to the genuine box photos  it was pretty obvious that I received knockoffs.  Amazon was really good about refunding my purchase after I complained.  Unfortunately  it looks like these keep getting sold by a series of slightly sketchy importers  using shifting names  and I don t fully trust that anyone selling Wheel Brightz under this listing is selling the genuine article.  So I bought a new set of Wheel Brightz from the manufacturer s website.I am super bad at mechanical stuff  but installation was OK.  Maybe 15-20 minutes per wheel.I got the pink one  my boyfriend got the multi-color.  They both look great.  The multi-color version looks kind of ugly when you re stationary compared to the other  more uniform colors  but it s totally sick when you re actually on the bike in motion -- it s like having a little rainbow whipping around your rim.  For thirty bucks you bring a lot of joy to the world -- we probably average one direct compliment for every 1-2 miles or so of biking  depending on pedestrian density (and I overhear a lot of people talking about the lights but not directly to us).  Typical encounters: A little kid in Bernal Heights shouted  you have a cool bike!  from his front porch.  A (probably slightly intoxicated) pedestrian in the Mission told my boyfriend he had the coolest bike in San Francisco and gave him a fist-bump.  Another stranger shouted   I like your Playa bike!  (this is not my Playa bike  although these lights would be perfect for Burning Man.)  The lights are very bright and visible  although you still need to have standard front and rear lights  as the Wheel Brightz can t be seen from directly behind or in front of the bike.Update: A year later  I still haven t had to change the batteries!  I have had to order one replacement power supply for my boyfriend s bike  though -- we hang our bikes vertically by the front wheel on wall-mounted hanging racks and over time  the power cord got caught between the wheel and the rack enough times that it frayed and wore through.  (You can avoid this if you are reasonably careful when you hang up your bike and avoid crushing the power connector cable -- it just hadn t occurred to us that this would be a problem until the cable broke  so we didn t bother trying to avoid it.)  More recently  a segment (about a quarter) of the lights on one of his wheels went out  although you can t tell when the bike is in motion.  Again  this is probably caused by hanging the bike by the front wheel.Update II: I ve gotten several more sets of these  and they re still great  but I notice that in some of the sets I ve bought more recently  in the initial packaging  the battery pack is screwed on so tightly I ve had to use an electric screwdriver to open it -- it would be nice if they could fix that and not over-tighten the screws!Update III: I recently brought a pair of these to Burning Man.  I noticed on the Playa that of all the different lighting schemes people used for their bikes  Wheel Brightz were the brightest and most visible -- far better than EL wire or front and rear lights.  If you are planning to go to Burning Man  I would recommend Wheel Brightz as an absolute must-have for your bike.       A 31 personas les resultó útil,5,2021-08-06T14:22:22

Yama,-,So fun and colorful!!               We really really love these lights. We now have them on all five of our bikes. We enjoy evening rides with the kids and these lights just make it even more fun. Anyone that sees it always comment on our lights. Yes they seem a little pricey but they make us happy and the visibility makes us safer so it s totally worth it. We had a problem with one strand after having it for a little over a month and the company was so quick to respond and send us a replacement. They even sent a little extra something to make up for the issue. Now my son is even more happy because his bike has more flare than the rest of us! I love companies that do little things like that.       A 2 personas les resultó útil,5,2021-09-18T14:22:22

I was under the false impression that this light string was held into place either solely by zip-ties or somehow using the tension of the spokes. This had me worried  as I bought it for my fat-bike  which has about a 1  gap in between the spokes. I expected to have to zip-tie the cord to every other spoke or something. Well  I was wrong. I only used one zip-tie and the rest just sort of... works. The string of lights has a much sturdier  heavy-duty tubing than I expected  so once you get them in between the spokes and complete the circle  the outward tension caused by the tube itself  holds the lights against the rim. These lights aren t quite as bright as I was expecting but they are definitely bright. I just expected them to reflect off of the street more than they do.Now  I own a fat bike with red rims  so that alone turns heads but these lights at night turn even more heads. On my first ride after installing them  I received my first compliment almost immediately  from the first person on foot that I rode by. I live in a developing suburban area  where there aren t many street lights  which makes these look even more cool.The only reason why I gave this product 4-stars instead of 5 is because I feel like you shouldn t have to completely remove the power box from the rim in order to change the batteries. Still a great product  though!       A 10 personas les resultó útil,4,2021-08-27T14:22:22

Very cool effect  highly visible on our dark rural streets   and she is the envy of the neighborhood!  Adults and kids both stop and stare at them in amazement.However  within 2 months and less than a dozen rides   the first flung off and ripped the wires from the light strip and cracked the solder connection from the circuit board to the battery contact.  Inspected the second units rubber strap and it was obviously about to fail as well.  The rubber straps are not durable.  The bikes are stored inside and only ridden on cool evenings so there s not much more one can do to protect them from the elements...they re just too cheaply made.Was able to repair the damaged strip and power box  then secured both with standard tyraps  so hopefully they will hold better.Other than that   they re a great product.

The product is very cool  bright and really stands out at night  my son loves it  and I am happy that he is being seen on the road at night. It was easy for him to install by himself. I also have the  bar  type of light from the same company  also well-made and has been in use for a while and continues to work fine as well. Please beware when you order something that is labeled  fulfilled by ______company  on Amazon  I was shipped a product that was not authentic  and possibly dangerous - for my child. As a mother let me tell you  nothing makes me angrier than this type of situation. ***DO NOT BUY! I can t believe I got ripped off! The first photo I posted is the  correct  item I purchased at a retail store  there is one light strip enclosed in tubing and a flat battery pack with the company name printed on it that you attach to your spokes. The second two photos show the product I received: the round battery pack that we figured out how to attach  I m not sure it would work this way for other bikes  it almost didn t work with my son s brakes. The third photo shows how thin the wire is  how it doesn t attach well and falls down. I am concerned about how safe this item is  there is not  water-proof tubing  included like the original. This is not as represented  how is this happening? Is anyone monitoring this stuff? Does Amazon make sure the products being sold are legitimate? Is anyone reading this? I m a loyal Amazon customer  I have purchased many items  I am concerned about the safety of my account as well.***       A 38 personas les resultó útil,4,2021-09-27T14:22:22

AmyAmy,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/913WsB17waL._SY800.jpg,Worth the buy               If you don t have a bike with spokes it s a little difficult. As you see  my son has mag wheels. Definitely not enough zip ties provided. Thankfully I have a lot of zip ties laying around. The tubes are a lot longer than the wheel is round  so I had to loop it around into the center. Tube is very flexible and easy to wrap. Be prepared to have extra zip ties for when you have to change the batteries. You have to zip tie over the battery pack to keep it on the wheel. Also  when cutting the ties  make sure to cuz the one on the battery flush or it will hit the front brake cable. I personally had to zip ties my sons brake cable closer to his frame so this didn t happen. Lastly  if riding on bumpy surface  lights will go out. Just push the button and it works. All in all  I m pleased with this product. I bought an extra one to wrap around his center frame too. Added bonus  not just for wheels. Every year my son is ghost rider and he is super excited to have his bike light up like fire       ,4,2021-02-28T14:22:22
Picky,-,All good!  Hope they last.               Have only had them on for 2 days  so I can t speak to their longevity - but so far  I love them!I got the blue lights.  I knew what to expect from reviews.I m not mechanically-minded  so I was a bit nervous at first.  The diagramed instructions that come with it tell you everything you need to know / do.  Important details are in CAPITAL letters  too.  Sounds silly but it helps.SUMMARY:  each of these steps is illustrated and described in detail on the page that comes with the lights:open battery box (4 screws)  -  pop in batteries (3 AA)screw battery box closed againremove attachment plate (2 screws)line attachment plate up with 2 spokes of the bike wheelscrew attachment plate on to box again  check for secure resultweave the light strand around spokes the way you want it (I did a spiral to the outer rim)plug end of light strand in into knob at start of strandsecure as desired with the enclosed zip-ties (SO easy!)I only listed all that so you know what  some assemby required  will look like.  It was kinda fun.You can turn them on and see them in the day  and they re ok.  On our ride last night in the dark  they were gorgeous!  I m glad I put them on the front wheel where I can see them.  They look SO cool.  You turn them on/off by pushing a small button on the front of the battery box  it s ridiculously easy.  They do look like the photo here.As long as these last awhile  they re 5/5 for me.p.s.  I handled them delicately to put them on;;  they might not do as well if you manhandle them.  Once in place  though  they have a nice plastic tubing to protect them.  So... we ll see!       A una persona le resultó útil,5,2021-03-17T14:22:22
D.M.,-,Fun at 75... with Wheel Brightz lights❗️               I love all my Brightz wheel lights don t have any long enough but at 75 years old & biking every night I reall love them all❗️However the battery strap broke on one & although I attached it with a rubberband  would you be so kind as to send me 1-2 (just in case) another breaks. These black wide bands hold much better than a rubberband. Everyone here in OBV love the colors. I have pink on my pink bike & pastel rainbow as the 2nd set on my front wheel. My other bike has purple on front wheel & green on back wheel. This is also a wonderful safety feature & fun too❗️       ,5,2021-02-28T14:22:22

I am very satisfied with my purchase  and love how my bike is now an attention-grabbing head-turner. I will admit  I was a little skeptical about cutting the tube and wires to size with a pair of scissors for sizing  but it did in fact work well. My only issue  which is nothing that the product can change is that I had a difficult time fitting the battery box into a good space on my narrower rear wheel. However with a bit of finger yoga I was able to make it all work.       A 7 personas les resultó útil,5,2021-01-23T14:22:22
Betsy,-,Huge fan  would definitely purchase again.               I love these things! I got them as a gift about a year ago  and they are still going strong. I got two pink strands  and installation was pretty simple. I bike at night at least once a week  for at least 15 minutes  and my lights are still doing great with the original batteries I added. They are VERY bright at night and give me visibility on poorly lit small-town streets  which is exactly why I wanted them. It makes me way more visible than my headlight and taillight ever did. I loved them so much  I bought them in green for a friend of mine  for her birthday.I live in SoCal  so not a ton of rain  but we actually had a pretty wet winter this past year and my bike sat out in the rain more than a few times  with no appreciable impact on the lights.As an added bonus  they look super cool  and I almost feel like I m riding a TRON Lightcycle when I m cruising in these...plus I get compliments all the time! People walking past are always shouting  cool wheels!  I ve also had several people roll down their car windows to yell  I like your bike lights!  or something similar as they drive past. While it always scares me a little at first  I appreciate that people are so overwhelmed by my awesome wheel lights that they want to share. WAY preferable to the obnoxious catcalls I get during the day.TL;DR--love them  would buy again.       A una persona le resultó útil,5,2021-02-13T14:22:22
Rose Armiger,-,Poor design               These lights are bright and easy to install. But  the battery pack is supposed to fix onto the bike spokes  and it will hit against your bike unless you have it installed in the exact perfect alignment. And it will bump out of alignment every time you go over a crack. It s really annoying to have that knocking with every revolution of the wheels  and I found myself having to stop and adjust it every few blocks. In addition  the on button came off at one point.       ,2,2021-05-11T14:22:22

The lights will make it easy for me to see at night and will add to the festival atmosphere :D I installed them on 700c wheels and there was extra after going all around  so I attached the extra along a spoke towards the middle of the wheel. This makes there be two more rings of light when the wheel spins.       A 12 personas les resultó útil,5,2021-03-06T14:22:22

Adam Wisniewski,-,The gold standard for bike wheel lights               I ve put several pairs of these lights on my bikes. They take me about 30 minutes to install properly so I never have to redo them again. Make sure to have more zipties than provided on hand. The major point of failure for these lights is the first stretch of wire from the battery pack - don t stretch that too tight or ever let it get snagged or damaged. Other than that  they are very long-lasting if you install them properly and securely from the get-go  and they are definitely waterproof. They would be absolutely perfect if they were USB rechargeable. Regardless of whether or not they re perfect  they are still the best wheel lights on the market.

Seattleite,-,Bright colors - I made this work for a kid s bike too.               These are nice and bright at night. You can t see them in the daytime. These are designed to fit into the spokes of wheels 20  or larger  but I bought these for a child s bike for a 4-year-old.  We simply wrapped them around the frame of the bike and secured everything with a handful of cable ties. Boom -- a fancy-schmancy rainbow light up bike.Brightz or sellers: please make the description about the colors clear. Much of the writing and sounds like it is available in 8 solid colors and color morphing---which implies 9 settings you can choose from. There s just -one- setting: always-on color morphing where it cycles through the colors on its own schedule. Please clarify this in the product details. Thanks.

Kathy Grimes,-,Install fail  lights are great.               I bought this product from a different vendor. I assume it was an older model because it hooked to the bike via a plastic guide on the back. This one  had a rubber gasket to attach the battery pack to the bike. It sucks the gasket has broken before I was able to get the darn thing attached. Oh I ll be able to use something I have here at the house to make it work. But I shouldn t have to do that. The problem is in order to get it so it doesn t slide all over the place you really have to hook the gasket very tight. I put it on  then realized it hit the break cable. So I had to take it off. I then tried a different spot and it hit the front forks. Now  I have it on  but had to put it inside the spokes not outside. It s probably safer there but by the time I figured it out and pulled it off and on several times the strap/gasket broke. This has more to do with the manufacture vs the seller. But still beware if you get the one with the strap/gasket to use something else before you put the strap on.       ,2,2021-04-09T14:22:22

They look amazing  and I get compliments all the time  but they also really work to light up the bike at dusk/night. You won t be able to use them instead of a headlight (to see the road ahead of you) but they do make you insanely visible and they light up the road underneath/around you. I love them in the white against my blue deepdish wheel rims - I think another color would look a but silly. The white against blue looks sharp as hell. I bet a colored light with a different combo rim would look rad though.       ,5,2021-02-04T14:22:22

The good thing is that these make you much more visible on the road  don t add a ton of weight  are easy to install  and relatively inexpensive.The bad thing is that these are not water proof at all  which is a big problem on a bicycle. The one on my front wheel stops intermittently  or won t function at all  in the rain. It will start working again once it dries out at least. The rear wheel does not seem to have this problem  probably because it is more protected by the rear fender.Overall  I think these are a worthwhile product for the price.

Jupiter07,-,Consider only buying one if you have disk brakes               To my knowledge  the spoke mounting system is not flexible enough in placement to be safely installed on rear wheels for systems with disk brakes.  I have gears on the one side of the back wheel and a disk brake on the other which prevented mounting.  So although I preferred for these to be on the back tire  I had to put the tube on the front. Good thing I didn t order two! Lots of compliments during a night ride in Seattle  and it lasted through 6 miles of pure Seattle rain at night with no issues.

Very easy to install. VERY BRIGHT. Combined with cosmic brightz  we feel incredibly safe riding at night. I mean your bike is just OBVIOUS.Some comments: changing the batteries is a pain. They last about ten hours. And we quickly learned to buy rechargeable batteries (which does drive up the initial cost). To change the batteries you need a screw driver and well it s not the easiest thing to do.But really there is no good replacement for this fantastic product.
